These sample Yalnix user programs are for your enjoyment in testing
your Yalnix kernel.  Some of the sample programs print out messages
(e.g., either with printf and/or TracePrintf) explaining some of what
they are doing, but in all cases, the best description of what each
sample program does is the source code for each.  If you have any
questions about any of the sample programs after reading the source
code, let us know.

One note of explanation on three of the sample programs:

 - init
 - console
 - shell

These three programs go together.  The "init" program can be used as
your kernel's init program, which then starts the "console" program
on TTY_CONSOLE and starts "shell" on each other terminal.  The shell
program acts (in a simple way) like a familiar shell.  When the
shell program exits, init collects that process's exit status and
starts a new shell on that same terminal.  When the console process
exits, the init process collects that process's exit status and
Halts Yalnix.
